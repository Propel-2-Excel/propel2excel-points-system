## üîç **Files That May Need Further Review**

### **Backend Models (`core/models.py`):**
```python
# These models may need to be added for full functionality:
class Professional:
    name: str
    specialties: str  
    email: str
    availability: dict

class ReviewRequest:
    student_discord_id: str
    status: str
    submission_date: datetime
    form_data: dict
    professional_id: int
```

### **Backend API Endpoints:**
```python
# These endpoints should be implemented:
- POST /api/bot/ with action: "review-status"
- POST /api/bot/ with action: "add-professional"  
- POST /api/bot/ with action: "list-professionals"
- POST /api/bot/ with action: "match-review"
- POST /api/bot/ with action: "review-stats"
```

### **Database Migrations (`core/migrations/`):**
- May need new migration for Professional and ReviewRequest models
- Consider adding fields to existing User model for review preferences

### **Admin Interface (`core/admin.py`):**
- Could add Django admin interfaces for Professional and ReviewRequest models
- Enable admin management of review system from web interface

### **API Serializers (`core/serializers.py`):**
- Add serializers for new models
- Update existing serializers if needed for review integration

### **Frontend Integration:**
- Student dashboard could show review request status
- Admin dashboard could show review management tools
- Analytics could include review system metrics

## üéØ **Current Architecture**

### **User Flow:**
