## üöÄ **REMAINING TASKS (5% Complete)**

### **ONLY Task: Deploy Professional Availability Form**

The system is 95% complete. You only need to deploy the professional availability Google Form:

#### **Step 1: Create Professional Availability Form**

1. Go to https://script.google.com/
2. Create a new project
3. Copy the code from `professional_availability_form_setup.js`
4. Update these URLs in the script:
   ```javascript
   const BACKEND_WEBHOOK_URL = 'https://your-backend-url.com/api/forms/professional-availability/';
   const FORM_SECRET = 'your-webhook-secret-here';
   ```
5. Run the `createProfessionalAvailabilityForm()` function
6. Copy the generated form URL

#### **Step 2: Set Up Webhook**

1. In the same Apps Script project, run `setupWebhook()`
2. Test with `testWebhook()` function
3. Share the form URL with professionals

#### **Environment Variables Needed**

```bash
# Required for Google Forms integration
FORM_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret-here

# Optional for Google Calendar integration  
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/service-account-key.json
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID=your-calendar-id@group.calendar.google.com
```

## üß™ **TESTING INSTRUCTIONS**

### **Quick Testing Workflow**

All bot commands are already implemented and working. To test:

#### **1. Deploy & Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python deploy_scheduling_system.py
```

#### **2. Test Bot Commands**
```bash
# Admin commands (already implemented)
!pending_reviews                    # See students waiting for matches
!suggest_matches @student           # Find professionals with overlapping times
!schedule_session @student "John Doe" "Monday 2:00 PM"  # Create calendar events
!review_stats                       # Real statistics from backend

# Student commands (already working)
!resume                             # Get form link  
!review_status                      # Check review status
```

#### **3. Test Professional Form (Once Deployed)**
1. Professional fills availability form
2. Check Django admin for new `ProfessionalAvailability` record
3. Test `!suggest_matches` to see if matching works
4. Test `!schedule_session` to create calendar events

#### **4. Verify Complete Workflow**
```bash
# Student Journey
!resume ‚Üí Student gets form ‚Üí Submits with availability

# Admin Journey  
!pending_reviews ‚Üí !suggest_matches @student ‚Üí !schedule_session @student "Pro" "Time"

# Result: Calendar invite sent to both parties
```
