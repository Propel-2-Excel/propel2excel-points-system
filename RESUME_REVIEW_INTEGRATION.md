- **Email System**: `propel@propel2excel.com`
- **Backend API**: `/api/bot/` endpoint with new activity types

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Backend Integration Pattern:**
```python
async def _backend_request(self, payload):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.post(
            f"{self.backend_url}/api/bot/",
            json=payload,
            headers={
                "Content-Type": "application/json",
                "X-Bot-Secret": self.bot_secret,
            }
        ) as response:
            return await response.json()
```

### **New Activity Types:**
- `resume_review_request` - When user starts review process
- Future: `resume_review_completed`, `professional_match`, etc.

### **Environment Variables:**
- `BACKEND_API_URL` - Backend API endpoint
- `BOT_SHARED_SECRET` - Authentication secret

## üìã **Backend Endpoints Needed**

The following endpoints should be implemented in the backend for full functionality:

### **Resume Review Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/bot/` with `action: "review-status"` - Check review status
- `POST /api/bot/` with `action: "add-professional"` - Add professional
- `POST /api/bot/` with `action: "list-professionals"` - List professionals
- `POST /api/bot/` with `action: "match-review"` - Create review match
- `POST /api/bot/` with `action: "review-stats"` - Get statistics

### **Data Models Needed:**
```python
# Professional model
class Professional:
    id: int
    name: str
    specialties: str
    email: str
    availability: dict

# Review Request model  
class ReviewRequest:
    id: int
    student_discord_id: str
    status: str  # pending, matched, completed, cancelled
    submission_date: datetime
    form_data: dict
    professional_id: int (optional)
    review_date: datetime (optional)
```
